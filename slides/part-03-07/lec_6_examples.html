# Amazon Q&amp;A Impact

- Newegg, etc.
- Imagine you work at Amazon
- Product specific controls by comparing two platforms (one with Q&amp;A, one without)

- Have to argue that Platform 2 &amp; Amazon have similar time trends (e.g. what about Amazon sales being all on the first day and dropping off after that, while Platform 2 is stable) and track each other similarly
- Using video games, they can identify "new" product entries and measure uniqueness across platforms.
