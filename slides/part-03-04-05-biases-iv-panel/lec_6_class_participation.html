# Intro to Causal Inference for Data Science
## ITAM Short Workshop
### Mathew Kiang, Zhe Zhang, Monica Alexander
### March 16, 2017

# Group Brainstorm Exercise

Possible Orgs:  
{Facebook, Civis Analytics, Chase Bank,  
Kaiser Chain of Hospitals, Health Department of Government of Mexico,  
Urban Housing Program, Insurance Company,  
Microfinance Platform, Agricultural Policy,
Google's Search Team, Amazon's }

Questions:  
1. Identify two causal questions of interest
2. Identify the ideal RCT to run (how to get participants, how to randomize, how to test)
3. Describe the ideal observational dataset
4. Describe a more realistic observational data, and how you might identify a causal effect of interest
5. Discuss with class (3-4 mins + time for class discussion &amp; feedback)

# Additional Topics

---
# Case Study: Gentzkow (AER, 2011)

- Effect of new goods on demand for existing goods? 
  - e.g., online news effect on existing physical newspaper demands? how would charging for online content affect physical sales?
  - e.g., radio airplay on record sales?
  - e.g., file-sharing and live concert revenues?
  - e.g., benefit of free-samples?
  
- Hard to estimate whether goods are complementary, or merely just due to consumer preferences
  - "two natural sources of variation"
  - variation in internet access at work or home (shifts only the utility of online)
  - panel data (24 hr windows)

--- 
# Impact of Yelp on Restaurant Sales (Luca)

- looks at a regression discontinuity
- identified by looking at the rounding that Yelp does, round up or round down.
- gets a lot of detailed data in the Seattle region
- more interestingly, the effect is driven by independent restaurants, rather than chains
- chain restaurants have declined in market share as Yelp penetration increased

---
# Impact of Tablet Adoption on Product Sales (Xu et al 2017)

- diff-in-diff setup, with panel data
- identify an effect with the iPad app release (but not Android or iPhone)
- only for those users who chose to adopt however

---
# Impact of Information on Markets

- "The Digital Provide: Information (Technology), Market Performance, and Welfare in the South Indian Fisheries Sector" (Robert Jensen, QJE 2007)

- Special:
  - entry of cell phones is arguably exogenous to the fisherman and the fish markets
  - usual studies of impact of cell phones is macroeconomic and difficult to tease out cause and effect
  - important to look at the impact of information enabled by technology

---
# Urban Agglomeration Impacts

Greenstone, Hornbeck, Moretti (JPE 2010)

- used random variation in manufacturing plant locations to identify agglomeration impacts
- very long paper, lots of robustness checks and model specification checks

---
# Amazon Q&amp;A Section Impact

- Also fits for Newegg, etc.
- Product specific controls by comparing two platforms (one with Q&amp;A, one without)
- Scraped the data, comparing the sales ranks, controls
- Have to argue that Platform 2 &amp; Amazon have similar time trends (e.g. what about Amazon sales being all on the first day and dropping off after that, while Platform 2 is stable) and track each other similarly
- Using video games, they can identify "new" product entries and measure uniqueness across platforms.

---
# Wikipedia Effect?

- What is effect of Wikipedia? Hard Question

- Georgia Tech economist used variation in translation into different languages timing

---
# Diff in Diff on Impact of Fake Hotel Reviews

- initial consistent difference between TripAdvisors and Expedia
- use 2nd variation on nearby value of independent hotels

---
# Reddit Random Voting

(Science paper, Muchnik et al 2013)
Effects, very diverse
Do we believe it though? It's not clear that down-voting can be triggered though.
Also upvotes affect the chance a posting is viewed, difficult.

---
# Marketplace, Platform, Network RCTs

Testing treatment groups can affect availability for the other control group
Or affecting only a portion of a seller's categories of goods

---
# Impact of Craigslist Ads on Newspapers

- study of platforms and multi-sided competition
- how do changes in competition affect platform firms? raise prices or lowers prices?
- use a diff-in-diff setup to study varied entry of Craigslist impacts
- their theory is robust, because they see less strong effects for newspapers without a classifieds manager increased prices substantially.
- and there is a larger reduction in display ads for these newspapers too
- use of Web Archive


---
# Impact of Airbnb on Hotel Revenues

Zervas, et al. (2016)

- diff-in-diff strategy
- high variation in the temporal rate and spatial density of Airbnb in Texas
- Lots of controls: location-specific demographics, hotel supply capacity, airport passenger counts, and Tripadvisor reviews
- They further identify that the effect is driven by Austin, TX

---
# Impact of Incentives on Ridesharing Platform Success

Kabra, Belavina, and Girota (2015)

- studies the impact of incentives on the supply and demand side of marketplace platforms
- uses a structural econometric model, calibrated to observed outcomes

---
# The Impact of Free: Movie Broadcasts on Other Channels

Telang, Smith (2009)

- uses the broadcast of movies on TV as variation in a demand shock
- measures whether the presence of pirated content affects retail sales
- find that the presence of pirated content need not hurt sales (sometimess)

---
# Simple Structural Modeling

- built a structural model for coal markets, using fundamentals on demand curves, supply curves, transaction costs.
- allows us to run simulations on what would happen with changes, with built in agent behavior changes based on theory and utility functions and calibrated latent parameters.

- also used to study regulatory cheating and firm monopoly power

- or looking at situations without explicit identification (lack of price changes, lack of demand changes for example)

---
# Things we Did Not Cover

- structural econometric modeling (identifying latent parameters and counterfactual simulations)
- GMM estimation
- ML and Mathematical Philosophy on Searching for Causal Structure
- more advanced time series techniques (event study methods)
- quantile regressions
- heterogenous treatment effects (use of ML techniques, or subset search techniques)
- standard errors calculation (correlated errors across region or time, standard error corrections)
