???

So this is kind of the roadmap. First, for the workshop. Causal inference is this huge field with lots of different approaches and we can't cover it all, but we want to hit the main points. First, the Rubin causal model or the **counterfactual model**, which is by far the most popular causal framework in social science. **NEXT SLIDE**

Then, within this framework, what is the ideal situation. Like all frameworks, there are fundamental assumptions. So first we'll go over situations when these assumptions are guaranteed to be met. **NEXT SLIDE**

Then we'll start to chip away at the assumptions and loosen them up a bit. So what are all the ways we won't meet this ideal situations? **NEXT SLIDE**

Finally, we'll spend a little bit today and all of tomorrow going over ways we can address these biases using analytical methods. (NOTE: We could address many of these using design-based methods, but we likely won't have time to go over that and it's not often you get to design studies as a data scientist.)

.right-column[
<br><br>
- **Introduction to Causal Inference**. Establish a framework we can all use.
]
???
So for today, we're going to do four talks. First, we're going to make sure we are all on the same page about what causal inference is. **NEXT SLIDE**

Second, within this framework, let's talk about estimating a causal effect in a best case scenario. **NEXT SLIDE**

Third, we'll talk about different obstacles to estimating causal effects. In the real world setting a randomized control trial is often not feasible or ethical so what can we do to ensure we aren't breaking the assumptions of our framework? **NEXT SLIDE**

And then we'll introduce a method to overcome some of these obstacles called instrumental variables and talk about how it attempts to mimic an RCT.

## Motivation
### Why do we care about causal inference at all?
???
So why do we even care about causal inference? Obviously, you guys care because you're here, but why should data scientists in general care about causal inference? 

---
# Almost all questions we are interested in are *causal*

???
Well, the simple answer is that most of the questions we are interested in are causal questions. 

Yet our tools are correlation based.

--

1. What is the effect of Drug B on the population?

1. How will increasing minimum wage affect the employment rate?

1. Do unconditional cash transfer programs help relieve poverty?

1. Will stricter gun laws reduce gun-related homocide?

If Edward takes Drug B and get a headache, did Drug B *cause* his headache?
]

???
What do we mean when we say something *caused* something else? We intuitively understand but what do we mean explicitly? 

Let's pretend I take a Drug and I get a headache. Did the Drug cause my headache?

It only caused my headache if we knew I wouldn't have gotten the headache, had I not taken the drug.
--
.right-column[
Implicitly, Drug B only caused the headache if Eddie would *not* have received the headache if Eddie had not taken Drug B.
]
--
.right-column[
So a causal effect is a comparison of two *potential outcomes* (or *counterfactuals*) on a unit (or a single set of units). Importantly, we only observe **one** outcome so all comparisons are hypothetical.

# Counterfactuals
]
.right-column[
So, we define our counterfactuals: 
- Let $A$ be a binary treatment with $1$ indicating the drug is taken and $0$ otherwise
- $Y^{a=0}$ is the outcome if Eddie had *not* taken the drug 
- $Y^{a=1}$ is the outcome if Eddie *had* taken the drug
]
???
So let's formalize this with a little bit of notation.

Some people prefer **potential outcomes** to emphasize that two different outcomes could potentially be observed depending on the treatment while others prefer **counterfactuals** to emphasize that each outcome represents situations that may not actually occur.
--
.right-column[
Then, Drug B has a causal effect if and only if $Y^{a=0}\neq Y^{a=1}$
]
--
.right-column[
The *__individual__ causal effect* of Drug B then is $ICE=Y^{a=1} - Y^{a=0}$

# Caveat about Rubin Causal Model

- Despite how it will feel when reading the literature, this is **not the only framework** of causal inference. 

--

- It is a very useful framework. But also limited — especially when evaluating things with no well-defined intervention. (For example, "Does obesity increase the risk of premature mortality?")

--

- Still an active debate. For an example, see debate in epidemiology between Nancy Krieger.red[*] et al. and Jamie Robins et al.

- Think of causal effects in terms of comparing **counterfactuals** or **potential outcomes**
]--
.right-column[
- However, we can never observe both counterfactuals — fundamental problem of causal inference.
]
--
.right-column[
- That's what makes causal inference so hard.
]
--
.right-column[
