Introduce ourselves. Thanks for opportunity. Quickly talk about the structure (2 days, 8 topics, about 50 minutes for each topic and then 10 minutes for a break / questions.)

Causal inference is this huge field with lots of different approaches and we can't cover it all, but for the workshop we want to hit the main points. First, the Rubin causal model or the counterfactual model, which is by far the most popular causal framework in social science. 

Then, within this framework, what is the ideal situation. Like all frameworks, there are fundamental assumptions. So first we'll go over situations when all these assumptions are guaranteed to be met.

Then we'll start to chip away at the assumptions and loosen them up a bit. So what are all the ways we won't meet this ideal situations?

Finally, we'll spend most of tomorrow going over ways we can mimic the ideal situation using different analytic methods.

So for today, we're going to do four talks. First, we're going to make sure we are all on the same page about what causal inference is.

Second, within this framework, let's talk about estimating a causal effect in a best case scenario.

Third, we'll talk about different obstacles to estimating causal effects. In the real world setting a randomized control trial is often not feasible or ethical so what can we do to ensure we aren't breaking the assumptions of our framework?

And then we'll introduce a method to overcome some of these obstacles called instrumental variables and talk about how it attempts to mimic an RCT.

So why do we even care about causal inference? Obviously, you guys care because you're here, but why should data scientists in general care about causal inference? This is an article from Wired Magazine and it has a bit of the sentiment we see a lot now.
