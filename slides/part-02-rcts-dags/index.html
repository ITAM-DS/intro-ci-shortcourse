# Roadmap
--

### Randomized Control Trials

- Thinking about causality in the ideal setting
--

### Causal Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs)

- Useful ways of encoding our beliefs and assumptions.

- Helpful for thinking about ways our assumptions can be wrong
--

### Back to RCTs and how they address biases 

- More about biases next lecture

# Randomized Control Trials

- First recorded RCT was done in 1747 by James Lind

- Scurvy is this terrible disease caused by Vitamin C deficiency and was a huge during long sea voyages

- Lind took 12 sailors with scurvy and split them into groups of 2:

    - Groups were assigned: (1) 1 qt cider, (2) 25 drops of vitriol, (3) 6 spoonfuls of vinegar, (4) 1/2 pt of sea water, (5) garlic, mustard, and barley water, (6) 2 oranges and 1 lemon

- Only Group 6 (citrus fruit) showed improvement

### Even with small sample size, Lind showed convincing causal effect

### We can gain knowledge without knowing the mechanism â€” Lind believed acid stupid putrefaction. Medicine had not yet understood importance of vitamins.

# RCT Definitions

.footnote[Hernan Epi 201]

- **Randomized**: The intervention is assigned randomly (either marginally or conditionally) 

--

- **Control**: There is (at least) one well-defined comparison group

--

- **Experiment**: Investigators (directly) control the intervention

- **Trial**: An experiment where the goal is to study effect of some medical intervention on humans

    - Trials have ethical requirements that experiments may not. (e.g., equipoise)

### In an ideal RCT, no loss to follow-up, perfect compliance, only one version of treatment, double (or triple) blind assignment
---
# Randomized Control Trials

- Recall from last lecture, because of the *Fundamental Problem of Causal Inference*, we can never observe both counterfactuals.
- Instead, we ask: under what conditions do the data we have properly estimate the data we want? 
- That is, when does: `$$Pr(Y^{a=1})-Pr(Y^{a=0})=Pr(Y|A=1)-Pr(Y|A=0)$$`
--

- Again, recall our assumptions for the Rubin causal model:
--

    - How do we ensure our groups *exchangeable*?
    - That we have *positivity*?
    - And that we have *stability*?

--

### These are all met in an ideal RCT

---
# Randomized Control Trials

.footnote[Hernan Epi 201]

- Suppose we have a large (nearly infinite) population of perfect compliers

- We divide them into two groups: (1) Group Heads and (2) Group Tails 

- We assigned the groups by flipping a (fair) coin

- Now, we decide to treat Group Heads and not treat Group Tails 

    - The risk of death in Group Heads is: `\(Pr[Y=1|A=1] = .75\)`

- Pretend that instead of doing this, we treated Group Tails and did not treat Group Heads. What would the expected risk of death in Group Tails be?

# Causal Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs)

.center[&lt;img src="./assets/basic_dag.jpg" width="200"&gt;]

- Graphically, the goal is to estimate magnitude and direction arrow. Statistically, we can only estimate the magnitude

- The edge itself can exist for at least 5 reasons:
    1. Just random luck
    1. `\(X\)` really does cause `\(Y\)` (causal)
    1. `\(Y\)` actually causes `\(X\)` (reverse causation)
    1. `\(X\)` and `\(Y\)` share a common cause (confounding)
    1. `\(X\)` and `\(Y\)` have a common effect that we are conditioning on (selection)
    
- Our job is to figure out which of these reasons is most consistent with the data and rule out all other explanations

# Rules for drawing a DAG

.center[&lt;img src="./assets/example_dag.jpg" width="200"&gt;]

- Time flows left to right (thus arrows always point right)

- An arrow implies our belief that something is *causal*

- The lack of an arrow implies our belief that things are *not* causal

- Everything we are concerned with exists in the DAG

# Reading DAGs: Causal assumptions

.center[&lt;img src="./assets/example_dag.jpg" width="200"&gt;]

- `\(X\)` and `\(U\)` are direct causes of `\(Y\)`
- `\(Y\)` is a direct cause of `\(Z\)`
- `\(X\)` and `\(U\)` are *not* direct causes of `\(Z\)`, but *indirect* causes through `\(Y\)`
- `\(X\)` and `\(U\)` are not causes of each other
- No two variables share a common cause

# Reading DAGs: Statistical implications

.center[&lt;img src="./assets/example_dag.jpg" width="200"&gt;]

- Edge implies statistical dependence
- No statistical dependence if there is a *collider*. Two arrow heads into one variable ($U \rightarrow Y \leftarrow X$)
- No statistical dependence if we *condition* or *block* a variable (denoted with a box around that variable) or a *descendent* of that variable
- There is statistical dependence if we block a collider or a descendent of that collider

# Reading DAGs: Statistical implications
.footnote[.red[*]Ch 16 by Maria Glymour in Methods Social Epidemiology]

.center[&lt;img src="./assets/example_dag.jpg" width="200"&gt;]

- `\(X\)` and `\(Y\)` are statistically dependent
- `\(U\)` and `\(Y\)` are statistically dependent
- `\(Y\)` and `\(Z\)` are statistically dependent

--
- `\(X\)` and `\(Z\)` are statistically dependent ($X \rightarrow Y \rightarrow Z$)
- `\(U\)` and `\(Z\)` are statistically dependent ($U \rightarrow Y \rightarrow Z$)

# Reading DAGs: Statistical implications
.footnote[.red[*]Ch 16 by Maria Glymour in Methods Social Epidemiology]

.center[&lt;img src="./assets/example_dag.jpg" width="200"&gt;]

- `\(X\)` and `\(U\)` are statistically independent (blocked by a collider `\(Y\)`)

--
- `\(X\)` and `\(U\)` are statistically dependent, conditional on `\(Y\)` (conditioning on a collider, unblocks that path)

--
- `\(X\)` and `\(U\)` are statistically dependent, conditional on `\(Z\)` (conditioning on a collider's descendent, unblocks that path)

--
- `\(X\)` and `\(Z\)` are statistically independent, conditional on `\(Y\)` (conditioning on `\(Y\)` blocks the `\(X \rightarrow Y \rightarrow Z\)` path)

--
- Similar to above, `\(U\)` and `\(Z\)` are statistically independent, conditional on `\(Y\)`.

# DAGs Assumptions
.footnote[.red[*]Ch 16 by Maria Glymour in Methods Social Epidemiology]

.center[&lt;img src="./assets/example_dag.jpg" width="200"&gt;]

1. **Causal Markov Assumption.** Any variable `\(X\)` is independent of any other variable `\(Y\)` conditional on on the direct causes of `\(X\)` (unless `\(Y\)` is an effect of `\(X\)`).
1. **Faithfulness.** Positive and negative causal effects never *perfectly* offset. 
1. **Neglible randomness.** Statistical associations (or lack of such associations) are never due to random change (i.e., large sample size assumption).
